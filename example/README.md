Perfect — let’s break down Google API authentication step by step, especially how it works in this context. You're mainly dealing with OAuth 2.0 authentication.

🔐 What is OAuth 2.0 (in simple terms)?
OAuth 2.0 is a way for apps to access user data securely without storing passwords.

When you authenticate with Google using OAuth:

The user is sent to a Google login page.

They approve permissions (like reading/writing Calendar events).

Google redirects back with an access token.

Your app uses this token to talk to the API.

🧱 Key Files and Concepts
1. credentials.json
This is the file you download from Google Cloud Console. It contains:

Your client ID & client secret.

Redirect URIs.

Tells Google who your app is.

It looks like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "xxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    ...
  }
}
You get it by:

Going to Google Cloud Console

Enabling the Google Calendar API

Creating OAuth 2.0 credentials under APIs & Services > Credentials

2. token.json
After the user logs in and grants access, Google gives your app a token, which it saves here.

It contains:

Access token (short-lived)

Refresh token (to get a new one when the first expires)

Expiry time

🔁 What Happens in the Code?
python
Copy
Edit
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
Creates the OAuth flow.

python
Copy
Edit
flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES)
creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
Reads your credentials.json

Opens a browser where the user logs in

Saves the resulting credentials to creds

python
Copy
Edit
with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
    token.write(creds.to_json())
Stores the access/refresh tokens so you don’t have to log in again.

🔄 Refreshing Tokens
python
Copy
Edit
if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
    creds.refresh(Request())
If your token is expired, this refreshes it automatically using the saved refresh token.

🔑 SCOPES
python
Copy
Edit
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']
This defines what kind of access you're asking for.

Some examples:

readonly: only lets you view

calendar: lets you read/write Calendar events (and create Meet links)
